#Take a beer

The web application I propose is a platform for selling barrels of beer to customers. The application is targeted towards craft beer enthusiasts and event planners who are looking to purchase beer in bulk for their parties and events.

The application will allow customers to browse through a wide variety of beer options, including different types of beer and sizes of barrels. Customers can view detailed product information such as alcohol content and flavor profile, and add items to their cart. The frontend will be designed to be fully responsive, allowing customers to browse and purchase products from any device.

Project will provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for customers to purchase barrels of beer in bulk. It will offer a wide selection of products, along with personalized recommendations and a streamlined purchasing process. The application will enable event planners and craft beer enthusiasts to easily and efficiently purchase high-quality beer for their parties and events.
